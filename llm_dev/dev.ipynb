Wireless equipment revenue increased by 17% \\nprimarily as a result of an increase in new subscribers purchasing \\ndevices and a continued shift in the product mix towards higher-\\nvalue devices. \\nCable service revenue increased this year primarily as a result of the \\nShaw Transaction and the impact of the July 2022 network outage-\\nrelated credits. \\nMedia revenue increased by 3% this year primarily as a result of \\nhigher sports-related revenue, including at the Toronto Blue Jays. \\nADJUSTED EBITDA \\nConsolidated adjusted EBITDA increased 34% this year and our \\nadjusted EBITDA margin increased by 290 basis points as a result of \\nsynergies and other efficiencies, including those recognized \\nthrough the Shaw Transaction an d the network outage-related \\ncredits issued to customers last year. \\nWireless adjusted EBITDA increased 12% this year, primarily due to \\nthe flow-through impact of higher revenue as discussed above. This \\ngave rise to an adjusted EBITDA service margin of 63.9%. \\nCable adjusted EBITDA increased 83% this year due to the flow-\\nthrough impact of higher reve nue as discussed above and the \\nachievement of cost synergies associated with integration activities. \\nThis gave rise to an adjusted EBITDA margin of 53.9%. \\nMedia adjusted EBITDA increased by $8 million this year primarily \\ndue to higher revenue as discussed above, partially offset by higher \\nToronto Blue Jays payroll costs. \\nNET INCOME AND ADJUSTED NET INCOME \\nNet income decreased by 49% this year, primarily as a result of \\nhigher depreciation and amortization, higher finance costs, and \\nhigher restructuring, acquisition and other costs, primarily \\nassociated with the Shaw Transaction and integration-related \\nactivities. Adjusted net income increased by 26% this year, primarily \\nas a result of higher adjusted EBITDA. \\nSee “Review of Consolida\\nted Performance” for more information. \\nCASH FLOW AND AVAILABLE LIQUIDITY \\nWe returned substantial cash to shareholders this year through the \\npayment of $960 million in dividends. In addition, we declared a \\n$0.50 per share dividend on January 31, 2024. \\nOur cash provided by operating ac tivities increased by 16% this \\nyear, primarily a result of higher adjusted EBITDA, as well as the \\nimpact of lower income taxes pa id, partially offset by higher \\ninvestment in net operating assets and higher interest paid, related \\nto the Shaw senior note financ ing (as defined below).

The Freedom Transaction did not include the sale of Shaw \\nMobile-branded wireless subscribers; accordingly, these wireless \\nsubscribers were acquired by Rogers. \\nOn April 3, 2023, following the completion of the Shaw \\nTransaction, Shaw was amalgamated with RCI. As a result of this \\namalgamation, RCI became the issuer and assumed all of Shaw’s \\nobligations under the indenture governing Shaw’s outstanding \\nsenior notes with a total principal amount of $4.55 billion as at \\nApril 3, 2023, of which $4.05 billion remained outstanding as at \\nDecember 31, 2023.

Mobile commerce continues \\nto increase as more devices and platforms adopt secure \\ntechnology to facilitate wireless transactions. \\nWireless providers continue to inve st in the next generation of\\n \\ntechnologies, like 5G, to meet increasing data demands. New \\nproducts and applications on the wireless network, such as wireless \\nprivate networks, will continue to rely on ultra-reliable, low latency \\ntransport networks, capable of supporting both wireless and \\nwireline traffic. \\nTo help make the cost of new wireless devices more affordable for \\nconsumers, Rogers and other Ca nadian wireless carriers offer \\ndevice financing programs. In 2023, we expanded financing \\navailable to Rogers customers by introducing the Rogers \\nMastercard, which provides 3% cash back value for Rogers \\ncustomers and allows consumers to finance up to the full cost of \\nthe device over a 36-month or 48-month term at 0% interest. We \\nbelieve being able to finance devices over 36 or 48 months will \\nhelp reduce churn. \\nIn addition to the wireless device financing plans now available, \\nsubscribers are increasingly bringing their own devices or keeping \\ntheir existing devices longer and therefore may not enter into term \\ncontracts for wireless services. This may negatively impact churn, \\nbut may also create gross addition subscriber opportunities as a \\nresult of increased churn from other carriers. This trend may also \\nnegatively impact the monthly service fees charged to subscribers \\nas they shop for plans that best meet their needs. \\nCABLE TRENDS \\nEconomic conditions, technology advancements, non-traditional \\ncompetitors, consumer behaviours, and regulatory developments \\nare key areas influencing Cable. This market is very capital intensive, \\nand a strong Internet offering is the backbone to effectively serving \\nthis market. Applications on the Internet are increasingly being \\nused as a substitute for wireline telephone services, and televised \\ncontent is increasingly available online.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'report.pdf', 'page': 24}, page_content='MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS \\nCanada’s economic condition co ntinues to be impacted by \\nrecessionary fears, rising interest rates and higher inflation. Housing \\naffordability remains a concern and rising immigration levels may \\npush housing demand and supply further apart, thus adversely \\nimpacting the demand for residential cable services. \\nCable and wireline companies are expanding their service offerings \\nto include faster broadband Internet, including consistently offering \\ndownload speeds of 1.5 Gbps, with certain plans offering \\nsymmetrical speeds of up to 8 Gbps in select areas, and Internet \\nofferings with unlimited bandwidth. Consumers are demanding \\nfaster-than-ever speeds for streaming online media, uploading \\npersonal content, playing online video games, and for their ever-\\ngrowing number of connected devices. In order to help facilitate \\nthese speeds, cable and wireline companies are shifting their \\nnetworks towards higher speed and capacity Data Over Cable \\nService Interface Specifications (DOCSIS) 3.1 and \\nfibre-to-the-home (FTTH) technologies and they are starting to \\nevolve their networks to be DOCSIS 4.0-capable. These \\ntechnologies provide faster potential data communication speeds \\nthan earlier technologies, allowi ng both television and Internet \\nsignals to reach consumers more quickly in order to sustain reliable \\nspeeds to address the increasing number of Internet-capable \\ndevices. \\nWireless home Internet, or Internet delivered using wireless cellular \\nsignals, is increasingly being offered by telecommunications \\ncompanies in Canada. This technology allows carriers to provide \\nhome Internet services to customers who are (i) otherwise unable \\nto be serviced by traditional wireline technologies or (ii) outside of a \\ncarrier’s cable network footprint, thereby expanding the effective \\nfootprint of customers. \\nPeople are increasingly working and studying from home, further \\nestablishing the need for strong and reliable cable networks that \\ncan handle increased capacity than previously existed. Cable and \\nwireline companies have needed to continue adding capacity and \\nmanaging traffic to continue reliably supporting the needs of \\nCanadians. \\nOur business customers use fibre-based access and cloud \\ncomputing to capture and share information in more secure and \\naccessible environments. This, combined with the rise of \\nmultimedia and Internet-based business applications, is driving \\nexponential growth in data demand. \\nBusinesses and all levels of government are transforming data \\ncentre infrastructure by moving toward virtual data storage and \\nhosting. This is driving dema nd for more advanced network \\nfunctionality, robust, scalable services, and supportive dynamic \\nnetwork infrastructure. \\nCanadian wireline companies are dismantling legacy networks and \\ninvesting in next-generation platforms that combine voice, data, \\nand video solutions onto a single distribution and access platform. \\nAs next-generation platforms become more popular, our \\ncompetition will begin to include systems integrators and \\nmanufacturers. \\nDevices\\n and machines are beco ming more interconnected and \\nthere is more reliance on the Internet and other networks to \\nfacilitate updates and track usage. \\nMEDIA TRENDS \\nConsumer viewing behaviours ar e continually evolving and the \\nindustry continues to adjust to these changes. Access to live sports \\nand other premium content has become even more important for \\nacquiring and retaining audiences that in turn attract advertisers \\nand subscribers. Therefore, ownership of content and/or long-term \\nagreements with content owners has also become increasingly \\nimportant to media companies.

Prepaid plans have also \\nevolved to have properties similar to those of traditional postpaid \\nplans. We believe this evolution provides consumers with greater \\nchoice of subscribing to a postpaid or prepaid service plan. Growth \\nin our customer base over time has resulted in higher costs for \\ncustomer service, retention, credit, and collection; however, most of \\nthe cost increases have been offset by gains in operating efficiencies. \\nWireless opera\\nting results are influenced by the timing of our \\nmarketing and promotional expend itures and higher levels of \\nsubscriber additions, resulting in higher subscriber acquisition- and \\nactivation-related expenses, typically in the third and fourth \\nquarters. Conversely, periods with higher activity may adversely \\nimpact churn metrics as a result of heightened competitive activity. \\nThe third and fourth quarters typically experience higher volumes \\nof activity as a result of “back to school” and holiday season-related \\nconsumer behaviour. Aggressive promotional offers are often \\nadvertised during these periods and also contribute to the impact \\non subscriber metrics. In contrast, we typically see lower subscriber \\nadditions in the first quarter of the year. \\nThe launch of popular new wireless device models can also affect \\nthe level of subscriber activity. Highly anticipated device launches \\ntypically occur in the spring and fall seasons of each year.

We expect our total estimated funding requirements for our \\nfunded defined benefit pension plans to be $9 million in 2024 and \\nto be adjusted annually thereafter based on various market factors, \\nsuch as interest rates, expected returns, and staffing assumptions. \\nChanges in factors such as the di scount rate, participation rates, \\nincreases in compensation, and the expected return \\non plan assets \\ncan affect the accrued benefit obligation, pension expense, and \\nthe deficiency of plan assets over accrued obligations in the future. \\nSee “Accounting Policies” for more information. \\nPension plans purchase of annuities \\nThis year, our defined benefit pension plans purchased \\napproximately $737 million of annuities from an insurance \\ncompany for substantially all the retired members in the \\nplans. The \\naggregate premium for the annuities was funded by selling a \\ncorresponding amount of existing assets from the plans.

To complete the materiality assessment, we \\ncompleted three primary workstreams. \\nFirst, we engaged with key internal and external stakeholders \\nthrough surveys, interviews, and sector insights reports to identify \\nour top material sustainability and social impact topics across our \\nvalue chain and time horizons. Stakeholder inputs were considered \\nin terms of level of influence on our strategy and their readiness to \\nengage with us. Stakeholders with whom we engaged included: \\n• the Board, our executives, and our employees; \\n• c u s t o m e r s ; \\n• shareholders; \\n• suppliers; \\n• Indigenous communities; \\n• government, regulatory, and industry groups; and \\n• non-governmental organizations and partners. \\nSecond, we assessed the materiality and likelihood of actual and \\npotential impacts for each material topic to prioritize amongst \\nthem, in line with our enterprise risk management framework. \\nFinally, we developed a materiality matrix that combined \\nstakeholder sentiment with the perceived prioritization of material \\nsustainability and social impact enablers to inform our \\nmanagement approach for each topic. \\nMATERIAL TOPICS \\nSupported by our foundational practices (see “Our Strategy, Key \\nPerformance Drivers, and Strategic Highlights”), our four most \\nmaterial sustainability and social impact topics are: \\n• network leadership and resilience; \\n• customer relationships; \\n• data privacy and security; and \\n• climate change mitigation and adaptation. \\nBy focusing our efforts on these topics, we aim to maximize value \\nfor our business, our shareholders, communities, and all other \\nstakeholders to which our operations are connected. We continue \\nto manage the remaining topics through our established \\nengagement processes and operations, all of which undergo \\nregular review and enhancements, to help ensure stakeholder \\nexpectations are met and material sustainability and social impact \\ntopics are embedded within our business.

As a part of this process, we pursue open and cooperative \\nrelationships with revenue authorities to minimize audit effort and \\nreduce tax uncertainty. We also en gage with government policy \\nmakers on taxation matters that affect Rogers and its shareholders, \\nemployees, customers, and other stakeholders. \\nINCOME TAX PAYMENTS \\nOur total income tax expense of $517 million in 2023 is higher than \\nthe expense computed on our accounting income at the statutory \\nrate of 26.2%, primarily as a result of a non-deductible change in \\nfair value of an obligation of one of our joint ventures to purchase \\nthe non-controlling interest in one of its investments and a \\nrevaluation of our deferred tax ba lances arising from a corporate \\nreorganization-driven change in income tax rate. Cash income tax \\npayments totalled $439 million in 2023. The primary reasons our \\ncash income tax is lower than our income tax expense are the \\ntiming of installment payments and the significant capital \\ninvestment we continue to make in our wireless and cable networks \\nthroughout Canada. Similar to tax systems throughout the world, \\nCanadian tax laws permit inve stments in such productivity-\\nenhancing assets to be deducted for tax purposes more quickly \\nthan they are depreciated for financial statement purposes. \\nOTHER GOVERNMENT PAYMENTS \\nIn addition to paying income tax on the profits we earn, we \\ncontribute significantly to Canadians by paying taxes and fees to \\nfederal, provincial, and municipal governments, including: \\n• various taxes on the salaries and wages we pay (payroll taxes) to \\napproximately 26,000 employees; \\n• property and business taxes; \\n• unrecoverable sales taxes and custom duties; and \\n• broadcast, spectrum, and other regulatory fees. \\nAs outlined in the table below, th e total cost to Rogers of these \\npayments in 2023 was $1,432 million. \\n Years ended December 31 \\n(In millions of dollars) 2023 2022 \\nIncome taxes paid 439 455 \\nAdd: \\nUnrecoverable sales taxes paid 11 15 \\nPayroll taxes paid 187 145 \\nRegulatory and spectrum fees \\npaid 1 723 670 \\nProperty and business taxes paid 72 48 \\nTaxes paid and other government \\npayments 2 1,432 1,333 \\n1 Includes an allocation of $418 million (2022 – $418 million) relating to the $3.3 billion, \\n$24 million, $1.7 billion, and $3.3 billion we paid for the acquisition of spectrum \\nlicences in 2014, 2015, 2019, and 2021, respectively. \\n2 Taxes paid and other government payments is a non-GAAP financial measure.

The \\npurpose of risk management is not to eliminate risk but to optimize \\ntrade-offs between risk and return to maximize value to the \\norganization. As such, we will kn owingly take certain risks to \\ngenerate earnings and encourage innovation that advance us as a \\ncustomer-centric market leader. To maintain our reputation and \\ntrust, we will always work to ensure the impacts (financial, \\noperational, strategic, regulatory, privacy, and cyber security) of our \\nrisk-taking activities are understood and are in line with our strategic \\nobjectives and company values. \\nRISK GOVERNANCE \\nThe Board has overall responsibility for risk governance and \\noversees management in identifying the key risks we face in our \\nbusiness and implementing appropriate risk assessment processes \\nto manage these risks. It delegates certain risk oversight and \\nmanagement duties to the Audit and Risk Committee. \\nThe Audit and Risk Committee discusses risk policies with \\nmanagement and the Board and assists the Board in overseeing \\nour compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. \\nThe Audit and Risk Committee also reviews: \\n• the adequacy of the internal cont rols that have been adopted to \\nsafeguard assets from loss and unauthorized use, to prevent, \\ndeter, and detect fraud, and to ensure the accuracy of the \\nfinancial records; \\n• the processes for identifying, assessing, and managing risks; \\n• our exposure to major risks and trends and management’s \\nimplementation of risk policies and actions to monitor and \\ncontrol these exposures, including cybersecurity, privacy, \\ntechnology, and environmental; \\n• the implementation of new major systems and changes to \\nexisting major systems; \\n• our business continuity and disaster recovery plans; \\n• any special audit steps adopted due to material weaknesses or \\nsignificant deficiencies that may be identified; and \\n• other risk management matters from time to time as determined \\nby the Audit and Risk Committee or directed by the Board. \\nENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT \\nOur Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) program uses the “3 Lines \\nof Defence” framework to identify, assess, manage, monitor, and \\ncommunicate risks. Our business units and departments, led by the \\nExecutive Leadership Team, are the first line of defence and are \\naccountable for managing or accepting the risks. Together, they \\nidentify and assess key risks, define controls and action plans to \\nminimize these risks, and enhance our ability to meet our business \\nobjectives. \\nERM \\nis the second line of de fence. ERM helps management \\nidentify the key and emerging risks in meeting our corporate and \\nbusiness unit objectives in line with our risk appetite. At the \\nbusiness unit and department level, ERM works with management \\nto provide governance and advice in managing the key risks and \\nassociated controls to mitigate these risks. Business Continuity is a \\nfunction within ERM which also assists the business in mitigating \\nkey risks. Specifically, the Busine ss Continuity function oversees \\nincident management and planning to maintain customer service, \\noperation of our network and businesses in the event of threats and \\nnatural disasters. Such threats include cyberattacks or equipment \\nfailures that could cause various degrees of network outages; \\nsupply chain disruptions; natural disaster threats; epidemics; \\npandemics; and political instability. Our ERM program also \\nincludes insurance coverage allowing us to transfer certain \\nrisks. Lastly, ERM works with Internal Audit to monitor the adequacy \\nand effectiveness of controls to reduce risks to an acceptable level. \\nAnnually, ERM carries out a corporate risk assessment.

Coordinating certain \\naspects of the operations and personnel of Rogers with Shaw will \\ninvolve complex operational, technological, and personnel-related \\nchallenges. In addition to the da y-to-day operations of Rogers, \\nmanagement will need to focus on the integration of the Shaw \\nbusiness. \\nCYBERSECURITY \\nOur industry is vulnerable to cybersecurity risks that are growing in \\nboth frequency and complexity. A dditionally, the introduction of \\n5G, cloud computing, increased digitization, and the use of \\nemerging technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), has \\nr e s u l t e d  i n  a n  i n c r e a s e  i n  c y b ersecurity risks and more complex \\ncybersecurity attacks. Rogers, along with our suppliers, employs \\nsystems and network infrastructure that are subject to cyberattacks, \\nwhich may include theft of assets, unauthorized access to \\nproprietary or sensitive information, destruction or corruption of \\ndata, ransomware attacks, or oper ational disruption. A significant \\ncyberattack against our critical network infrastructure and \\nsupporting information systems (or those of our suppliers) could \\nresult in service disruptions, litigation, loss of customers, incurring \\nsignificant costs, and/or reputational damage. \\nWe\\n routinely work with third-pa rty providers, including cloud \\nservice providers, whose products and services are used in our \\nbusiness operations. These third-party providers have experienced \\ncybersecurity attacks in the past and, based on industry trends, we \\nexpect will continue to experience cybersecurity attacks that \\nattempt to obtain unauthorized access to our sensitive information \\nor create operational disruptions. In some cases, cybersecurity \\nthreat actors may fraudulently attempt to social engineer our \\npersonnel, customers, or suppliers to disclose sensitive information, \\nplant malicious software, provide access credentials, or take other \\nfraudulent actions. \\nWe have experienced a significant increase in social engineering \\nattacks targeting our team members and our suppliers. These \\nattacks, often perpetrated by organized cybercriminal groups, \\ninvolve persuading the targeted individuals to share their access \\ncredentials, which are then used to steal data or carry out \\nunauthorized changes to our customers’ accounts. \\nWe have a robust information and cybersecurity program that \\nincludes established cyber governance practices designed to \\nreinforce the importance of re maining a secure, vigilant, and \\nresilient organization. Our ongoing success depends on protecting \\nour sensitive data and key servic e delivery systems, including \\npersonal information about our customers and employees.

The impact of such \\nattacks may affect our customer service, key service delivery \\nsystems, or our financial results. We continue to invest in our \\ncybersecurity program and conduct regular assessments to test our \\nresiliency. \\nPRIVACY \\nIn the evolving digital world, privacy and the ways in which \\norganizations handle personal information are becoming \\nincreasing priorities for consumers. Ensuring appropriate \\ngovernance over this data has become even more critical. As the \\nmove to digital transactions accelerated over the past several years, \\ncompanies continued to gain greater amounts of data on \\ncustomers and employees. The nature of the products and services \\nwe offer our customers means we are entrusted with a significant \\namount of personal information. This means that ensuring there are \\nappropriate safeguards and privacy protections in place is a priority \\nfor us. We are the stewards of this data and this responsibility is of \\nthe utmost importance to us. If a privacy breach were to occur and \\npersonal information was made public, there could be a material \\nadverse effect on our reputation and our business. \\nTECHNOLOGY \\nNew technologies \\nOur network plans assume the availability of new technology for \\nboth wireless and wireline networ ks, including 5G technology in \\nthe wireless industry and future DOCSIS enhancements and \\nevolutions in the wireline indust ry. While we work with industry \\nstandards bodies and our vendors to ensure timely delivery of new \\ntechnology, there are no assuranc es these technologies will be \\navailable as and when required. Delays in the availability of the new \\ntechnologies may adversely impa ct our go-to-market plans for \\noffering new products and services to our customers. \\nAs\\n new technologies become avai lable, we expect a substantial \\nportion of our future revenue growth may come from new and \\nadvanced services, and companies such as Rogers will need to \\ncontinue to invest significant capital resources to develop our \\nnetworks and implement in an agile framework to meet customers \\nand business timelines. It is possible, however, that there may not \\nbe sufficient consumer demand, or that we may not anticipate or \\nsatisfy demand for certain products and services or be able to offer \\nor market these new products and services successfully to \\nsubscribers. If we do not attract subscribers to new products and \\nservices profitably or keep pace with changing consumer \\npreferences, we could experience slower revenue growth and \\nincreased churn.

Further, our businesses depend on \\nIT systems for day-to-day operations and critical elements of our \\nnetwork infrastructure and IT systems are concentrated in various \\nphysical facilities. If we are unable to operate our systems, make \\nenhancements to accommodate customer growth and new \\nproducts and services, or if our systems experience disruptions or \\nfailures, it could have an adverse effect on our ability to acquire new \\nsubscribers, service customers, manage churn, produce accurate and \\ntimely subscriber invoices, generate revenue growth, and manage \\noperating expenses. This could have a material adverse impact on \\nour business, results, and financial position. \\nImpa\\nct of failures on customer service \\nCustomers have high expectations of  reliable and consistent \\nperformance of our networks. Failure to maintain high service levels \\nand to effectively manage network traffic could have an impact on \\nthe customer experience, potentially resulting in an increase in \\ncustomer churn. Due to the increased demand and traffic on our \\nnetworks, there could be capacity and congestion pressures. If our \\nnetworks or key network or IT comp onents fail, it could, in some \\ncircumstances, result in a loss of service for our customers for \\ncertain periods and have a material adverse effect on our business, \\nresults, and financial position. \\nWe\\n work to protect our networks and our service from the impact \\nof natural disasters and major weather events such as ice storms, \\nwind storms, forest fires, flooding, earthquakes, or landslides where \\nit is necessary and feasible to do so.

There is no assurance that our \\ncurrent or future competitors will not provide services that are \\nsuperior to ours or at lower prices, adapt more quickly to evolving \\nindustry trends or changing market requirements, enter markets in \\nwhich we operate, or introduce competing services. The federal \\ngovernment also continues to promote competition and \\naffordability, and is committed to universal high-speed Internet for \\nevery Canadian by 2030. Canadian regulators continue to consider \\nwhether the regulatory framework governing wholesale wireline \\nand wireless access should be expanded. Any of these factors \\ncould increase churn or reduce our business market share or \\nrevenue. \\nDepending on various factors including economic conditions and \\nresponses from our competitors and/or current and potential \\ncustomers, we may need to change our wireless pricing offers to \\nattract new customers and retain existing subscribers. As wireless \\npenetration of the population deepens, new wireless customers \\nmay generate lower average monthly revenue, which could slow \\nrevenue growth. \\nGlobal\\n technology giants continue to ramp up content spending \\ninto new markets such as sports media, resulting in increased \\ncompetition for our Media and Cable segments.

Overall increased competition for content could \\nincrease costs of programming rights. As broadcasters and \\ndistributors sign longer-term agreements to secure programming \\nrights, this could affect the availability of desirable programming \\nrights and result in lower revenue due to a lack of access to these \\nrights. Lower revenue in turn could adversely affect the operating \\nresults of our business if we are unable to recover programming \\ninvestments through advertising revenue and subscription fee \\nincreases that reflect the market. \\nIn addition, the Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications \\nCommission (CRTC) Broadcasting Distribution Regulations do not \\nallow cable operators to obtain exclusive contracts in buildings where \\nit is technically feasible to install two or more transmission systems. \\nContinued deployments of fibre networks by competitors may lead \\nto an increase in the reach, speed, and stability of their wireline-\\nrelated services. This could result in an increase in churn pertaining \\nto our wireline business segment services. \\nImprovements in the quality of streaming video over the Internet, \\ncoupled with increasing availability of television shows and movies \\nonline through OTT content providers, has resulted in competition for \\nviewership and increased competition for Canadian cable television \\nservice providers. As a result, we have noticed an increase in cord \\ncutting and cord shaving as consumers continue to withdraw from \\ntraditional cable services. If advances  i n  t echn o l o g y a r e m a d e t o  a n y \\nalternative Canadian multi-channel broadcasting distribution system, \\nour cable services may face increased competition.

This \\nregulation relates to, among other things, licensing and related \\nfees, competition, the cable television programming services we \\nmust distribute, wireless and wireline interconnection agreements, \\nthe rates we may charge to provide access to our networks by third \\nparties, the resale of our networks and roaming on our networks, \\nour operation and ownership of communications systems, and our \\nability to acquire an interest in other communications systems. In \\naddition, the costs of providing services may be increased from \\ntime to time as a result of complia n c e  w i t h  i n d u s t r y  o r  l e g i s l a t i v e \\ninitiatives to address consumer protection concerns or issues such \\nas copyright, privacy, cybercrime, and lawful access. \\nGenerally, our licences are granted for a specified term and are \\nsubject to conditions. These licensing conditions, including the related \\nfees, may be modified at any time by the regulators. The regulators \\nmay decide not to renew a licence when it expires, and any failure by \\nus to comply with the conditions on the maintenance of a licence \\ncould result in a revocation or forfeiture of any of our licences or the \\nimposition of fines.

Our abil ity to continue to offer and \\nimprove current services and to offer new services depends on, \\namong other factors, continued access to, and deployment of, \\nadequate spectrum, including the ability to both renew current \\nspectrum licences and acquire new spectrum licences. \\nI\\nf we cannot acquire and retain needed spectrum, whether due to \\nunfavourable spectrum auction rules, licence conditions, or other \\nfactors, we may not be able to continue to offer and improve our \\ncurrent services and deploy new services on a timely basis, \\nincluding providing competitive data speeds our customers want. \\nAs a result, our ability to attract and retain customers could be \\nadversely affected. In addition, an inability to acquire and retain \\nneeded spectrum could affect network quality and result in higher \\ncapital expenditures. \\nChanges to government spectrum fees could significantly increase \\nour payments and therefore materially reduce our net income. \\nRadio frequency emissions \\nFrom time to time, media and other  reports have highlighted \\nalleged links between radio freq uency emissions from wireless \\ndevices (including new 5G tech nology) and various health \\nconcerns, including cancer, and interference with various medical \\ndevices, including hearing aids and pacemakers. This may \\ndiscourage the use of wireless devi ces or expose us to potential \\nlitigation even though there are no definitive reports or studies \\nstating that these health issues are directly attributable to radio \\nfrequency emissions. Future regulatory actions may result in more \\nrestrictive standards on radio frequency emissions from \\nlow-powered devices like wireless devices. We cannot predict the \\nnature or extent of any restrictions. \\nObtai\\nning access to support structures and municipal rights of \\nway \\nTo build and support the rollout of 5G, and to continue upgrading \\nour\\n wireline network, we must ha ve access to support structures \\nand municipal rights of way to install equipment on municipal \\npoles and buildings, and on Indigenous land. Under the \\nTelecommunications Act, the CRTC has jurisdiction over support \\nstructures owned by telecommunication carriers and municipal \\nrights of way. The CRTC’s jurisdiction does not extend to electrical \\nutility support structures, which are regulated by provincial utility \\nauthorities. \\nCUSTOMER EXPERIENCE \\nOur customers’ loyalty and their likelihood to recommend Rogers \\nare both dependent upon our ability to provide a service \\nexperience that meets or exceeds their expectations.

If \\nour services do not deliver the usage experience our customers \\nexpect from us, and if we do not have clear, simple, and fair \\ninteractions with our customers, it could cause confusion and \\nfrustrate our customers and have  a negative  impact to our \\nreputation or brand. This could also result in lost sales opportunities \\nor customers switching to a competitor for some or all of their \\nservices, either of which could have a  material adverse impact on \\nour business, results, and financial condition. \\nRESULTS PERFORMANCE \\nWe strive to drive profitable growth in all markets we serve. This \\nmeans we will focus on core growth drivers in each of our businesses, \\nincluding increasing subscribers and reducing churn, expanding \\nproducts in our enterprise business, and returning Media to growth. \\nAt the same time, our goal is to continue to develop strong \\ncapabilities in cost management to support investments that will fuel \\nour future. If we are not successful in achieving these goals, as a result \\nof economic conditions or the co mpetitive landscape, this could \\nnegatively impact confidence with investors and external \\nstakeholders, and ultimately our stock price. \\nTALENT ACQUISITION AND RETENTION \\nA significant transformation is underway in our industry, and as \\ncompetition for talent increases, our success is highly dependent \\non our ability to attract and retain a high-performing, diverse, and \\nengaged workforce, including in key growth areas, such as the \\nnetwork, IT, and digital fields. Our focus must be on providing \\ncareer and development opportunities, competitive compensation \\nand benefits, fostering an inclusive and diverse workplace, and a \\ngreat employee experience. Failure to maintain and achieve this \\nfocus, and changes to our workforce as a result of factors such as \\nturnover and restructuring, failing to develop internal succession, \\ncost reduction initiatives, ongo ing union negotiations, or other \\nevents, could have an adverse effect on the customer experience, \\nand as a result our revenue and profitability. \\nRELIANCE ON SUPPLY CHAIN AND THIRD PARTIES \\nWe have outsourcing, managed service, and supplier \\narrangements with third parties to provide certain essential \\ncomponents of our business operations to our employees and \\ncustomers. These include, but are not limited to, certain critical \\ninfrastructure components and de vices, facilities or property \\nmanagement functions, contact centre support, installation and \\nservice technicians, and network and IT functions. If interruptions in \\nthese services or at these suppliers occur, including global supply \\nchain issues, it could adversely affect our ability to provide service to \\nour customers, which could have an adverse effect on our revenue \\nand profitability. \\nFINANCIAL RISKS \\nCapital commitments, liquidity, debt, and interest payments \\nOur capital commitments and financing obligations could have \\nimportant consequences, including: \\n• requiring us to dedicate a substa ntial portion of cash provided \\nby operating activities to pay interest, principal amounts, and \\ndividends, which reduces funds available for other business \\npurposes, including other financial operations; \\n• making us more vulnerable to adverse economic and industry \\nconditions; \\n• limiting our flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in \\nour business and industry; \\n• putting us at a competitive disadvantage compared to \\ncompetitors who may have more financial resources and/or less \\nfinancial leverage; or \\n• restricting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund \\nworking capital and capital expenditures and for other general \\ncorporate purposes.'),\n",

Our \\nbusiness may not generate sufficient cash flow in the future and \\nfinancings may not be available to provide sufficient net proceeds \\nto meet our obligations or to successfully execute our business \\nstrategy. \\nCredit ratings \\nCredit ratings provide an independent measure of credit quality of \\na securities issuer and can affect our ability to obtain short- and \\nlong-term financing and the terms of the financing. In connection \\nwith the Shaw Transaction, each of S&P, Moody’s, Fitch, and DBRS \\nMorningstar downgraded our corporate credit issuer default rating \\nand our senior unsecured debt ratings by two notches. If rating \\nagencies lower the credit ratings on our debt further, particularly a \\ndowngrade below investment-grade, it could adversely affect our \\ncost of financing and access to liquidity and capital. \\nCapital markets \\nExternal capital market conditions could affect our ability to make \\nstrategic investments and meet ongoing capital funding \\nrequirements. Risk factors include a reduction in lending activity, \\ndisruptions in capital markets, and regulatory requirements for an \\nincrease in bank capitalization, which could reduce the availability \\nand/or increase the cost of capital. \\nIncome taxes and other taxes \\nWe collect, pay, and accrue significant amounts of income and \\nother taxes, such as federal and provincial sales, employment, and \\nproperty taxes. \\nWe have recorded significant am ounts of deferred and current \\nincome tax liabilities and expense, and calculated these amounts \\nbased on substantively enacted inco me tax rates in effect at the \\nrelevant time. A legislative change in these rates could have a \\nmaterial effect on the amounts recorded and payable in the future. \\nWe provide for income and other taxes based on all currently \\navailable information and believe  that we have adequately \\nprovided for these items. The calculation of applicable taxes in \\nmany cases, however, requires significant judgment in interpreting \\ntax rules and regulations. Our tax filings are subject to audits, which \\ncould materially change the amount of current and deferred \\nincome tax assets, liabilities, and expense, and could, in certain \\ncircumstances, result in the assessment of interest and penalties. \\nWhile we believe we have paid and provided for adequate amounts \\nof tax, our business is complex and significant judgment is required \\nin interpreting how tax legislation and regulations apply to us. \\n67 | ROGERS COMMUNICATIONS INC. 2023 ANNUAL REPORT'),\n",

Recessions, declines in \\neconomic activity, and economic uncertainty can erode consumer \\nand business confidence and reduce discretionary spending. Any \\nof these factors can negatively affect us through reduced \\nadvertising, lower demand for our products and services, \\ndecreased revenue and profitability, and higher churn and bad \\ndebt expense. A significant portion of our broadcasting and digital \\nrevenue comes from the sale of advertising and is affected by the \\nstrength of the economy. \\nStrategy and business plans \\nOur strategy is vital to our long-term success. Changing strategic \\npriorities or adding new strategic priorities could compromise \\nexisting initiatives and could have a material adverse effect on our \\nbusiness, results of operations, and financial condition. \\nWe develop business plans, execute projects, and launch new \\nventures to grow our business. If the expected benefits from these \\ndo not materialize, this could have a material adverse effect on our \\nbusiness, results of operations, and financial condition. \\nOur products, services, and networ ks rely, in part, on certain \\nvendors. Should our vendors not deliver solutions that operate as \\nintended, our business and financ ial results could be adversely \\naffected. This may result in subs criber losses, lower revenue, and \\nunfavourable customer satisfaction. \\nMonitoring and controlling fraudulent activities \\nAs a \\nlarge company with tens of thousands of employees and a \\nrange of desirable and valuable products and services, fraud \\nprevention requires a discipli ned program covering governance, \\nexposure identification and assessment, prevention, detection, and \\nreporting. This program must consider corruption and \\nmisappropriation of assets by employees and/or external parties. \\nFraud events can result in financial loss and brand degradation. In \\naddition to unauthorized access to digital boxes and Internet \\nmodems, a sample of potential examples of fraud relevant to us \\ninclude (i) inappropriate use of our cable or wireless networks, \\n(ii) subscription fraud and fraudulent account takeovers for purpose \\nof hardware theft or SIM swapping, (iii) intentional manipulation of \\nfinancial statements by employees and/or external parties, and \\n(iv) copyright theft and other forms of unauthorized use that \\nundermine the exclusivity of our content offerings. \\nUnauthorized access to digital boxes or Internet modems \\nWith a significant number of Canadians purchasing illegal \\npre-loaded set-top boxes and illegally streaming our television \\nproducts, cord-shaving, cord-cutting and customer churn rates \\ncould increase. To address this, we use encryption technology \\ndeveloped and supported by our vendors to protect our cable \\nsignals from unauthorized acce ss and to control access to \\nprogramming based on subscription packages. We also use \\nencryption and security technologies to prevent unauthorized \\naccess to our Internet service. \\nThere is no assura\\nnce that we will be able to effectively prevent \\nunauthorized decoding of television signals or Internet access in \\nthe future.

To measure the successful \\nachievement of this objective, the CRTC has established several \\ncriteria, including: \\n• 90% of Canadian residentia l and business fixed broadband \\nInternet access service subscrib ers should be able to access \\nspeeds of at least 50 Mbps download and 10 Mbps upload, and \\nto subscribe to a service offering with an unlimited data \\nallowance by 2021, with the remaining 10% of the population \\nreceiving such service by 2031; and \\n• the latest generally deployed mobile wireless technology should \\nbe available not only in Canadian homes and businesses, but on \\nas many major transportation roads as possible in Canada. \\nTo help attain the universal service objective, the CRTC intends to \\nshift the focus of its regulatory frameworks from wireline voice \\nservices to broadband Internet access services. The following \\nservices that form part of the universal service objective are \\nconsidered basic telecommunications services within the meaning \\nof subsection 46.5(1) of the Telecommunications Act: \\n•\\n fixed and mobile wireless broa dband Internet access services; \\nand \\n• fixed and mobile wireless voice services. \\nTo assist in extending broadband into underserved rural and \\nremote locations, the CRTC stated that it would establish a new \\nbroadband fund to which all entities providing Internet services in \\nCanada must contribute. The specifics of the fund, including \\nguiding principles, fund design, and assessment criteria, were \\nestablished in Telecom Regulatory Policy CRTC 2018-377, \\nDevelopment of the CRTC’s Broadband Fund, released on \\nSeptember 27, 2018. Two calls for applications occurred in 2019. \\n2020 marked the first year of payments into the fund, with a \\nmaximum funding level of $100 million in the first year of \\nimplementation. This level was to increase by $25 million annually \\nover the following four years to reach an annual cap of \\n$200 million, with the incremental increases in years four and five \\ncontingent on a review of the fund in the third year to ensure it is \\nbeing managed efficiently and is achieving its intended purpose. \\nA percent of revenue levy has been applied on wireline and \\nwireless voice revenues since 2000 to support providing voice \\nservice to designated high-cost lo cal voice serving areas and to \\nprovide a national video relay service (VRS). In 2016, pursuant to \\nTelecom Regulatory Policy CRTC 2016-496, the CRTC updated the \\nbasic services definition to include voice and data services and set \\nin motion the evolution of the subsidy program to transition from \\nvoice-centric subsidies to subsidies to support investment in \\nbroadband access networks through the establishment of the CRC \\nBroadband Fund. As planned in Telecom Regulatory Policy CRTC \\n2018-213, the voice subsidy was eliminated in 2021. \\nThe\\n CRTC collected $176 million of contributions in 2020, \\n$180 million in 2021, and $194 million in 2022. On December 20, \\n2023, the CRTC set a final 2023 revenue-percentage charge of \\n0.46% and set the interim 2024 rate at 0.46%. The percent of \\nrevenue levy is applied to voice and date revenues with limited \\nexceptions. The interim 2024 rate is subject to finalization in \\nDecember 2024. \\nOn March 23, 2023, the CRTC initiated a review of the Broadband \\nFund.

On September 7, 2022, we \\nannounced that a formal memorandum of understanding had \\nbeen signed among Canada’s major telecommunications carriers \\nregarding reciprocal support for emergency roaming, mutual \\nassistance, and communications protocols in the event of a future \\nnetwork outage. \\nOn July 12, 2022, the CRTC issued a request for information asking \\nus to respond to detailed questions and provide a comprehensive \\nexplanation regarding the network outage. The CRTC has requested \\na detailed account as to why and how this network outage \\nhappened, as well as what measures we will put in place to prevent \\nfuture outages. On July 22, 2022, we provided responses to the \\nCRTC’s questions. On August 5, 2022, the CRTC issued a \\nsubsequent request for information, responses to which were filed by \\nRogers on August 22, 2022. The CRTC has engaged an external \\nparty to prepare a report and Rogers has participated in this process. \\nThe\\n House of Commons Standing Committee on Industry and \\nTechnology held meetings to st udy the network outage in July \\n2022, during which representatives from Rogers, amongst others, \\nappeared. \\nWIRELESS \\n3800 MHZ SPECTRUM LICENCE BANDS \\nISED Canada’s 3800 MHz spectrum licence auction began on \\nOctober 24, 2023 and concluded on November 24, 2023; the \\nresults were released on November 30, 2023. Twenty-two \\ncompanies participated in the auction and 4,099 of 4,300 licences \\nwere awarded to twenty of those participants, with a total value of \\n$2.2 billion.

The Framework lays \\nout the criteria ISED Canada will consider and the processes it will \\nuse when it reviews spectrum licence transfers, including \\nprospective transfers that could arise from purchase or sale options \\nand other agreements. Key items to note are that: \\n•\\n ISED Canada will review all spectrum transfer requests and will \\nnot allow any that result in “undue spectrum concentration” and \\nreduced competition. Decisions will be made on a case-by-case \\nbasis and will be issued publicly to increase transparency; and \\n• licensees must ask for a review within 15 days of entering into \\nany agreement that could lead to a prospective transfer.

Under the Wireless Code, if a customer cancels a \\ncontract early, carriers can only charge the outstanding balance of \\nthe device subsidy or financing they received. \\nTOWER SHARING POLICY \\nIn March 2013, ISED Canada rele ased Revised Frameworks for \\nMandatory Roaming and Antenna Tower and Site Sharing, \\nconcluding a consultation initiated in 2012. It sets out the current \\nrules for tower and site sharing, among other things. The key terms \\nof the tower and site sharing rules are: \\n•\\n all holders of spectrum licences, radio licences, and \\nbroadcasting certificates must share towers and antenna sites, \\nwhere technically feasible, at commercial rates; and \\n• the timeframe for negotiating agreements is 60 days, after which \\narbitration according to ISED Canada arbitration rules will begin. \\nIn Telecom Regulatory Policy 2015-177, Regulatory framework for \\nwholesale mobile wireless services, released in May 2015, the CRTC \\ndetermined that it would not mandate or require general \\nwholesale tariffs for tower and site sharing. At the same time, it \\ndetermined that its existing powers and processes are sufficient to \\naddress tower and site sharing disputes related to rates, terms, and \\nconditions. As a result, carriers may use the arbitration process \\nestablished by ISED Canada, or they may request the CRTC to \\nintervene in the event that tower and site sharing negotiations fail. \\nPOLICY DIRECTION TO THE CRTC ON \\nTELECOMMUNICATIONS \\nOn June 17, 2019, the Order Issuing a Direction to the CRTC on \\nImplementing the Canadian Telecommunications Policy Objectives \\nto Promote Competition, Affordability, Consumer Interests and \\nInnovation came into effect.

The CRTC mandated \\nwholesale mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) access, \\nseamless handoff for mandated wholesale roaming, and new \\nmandatory low-cost and occasional-use retail rate plans; however, \\nmandated MVNO access will only be provided if certain conditions \\nare met. \\nThe CRTC decided that mandated wholesale MVNO access must \\nbe offered by the national carrier s, and SaskTel in Saskatchewan, \\nbut only made available to eligib le regional wireless carriers that \\nhold mobile spectrum licences, and only in the areas that are \\ncovered by their licences. The terms and conditions associated with \\nmandated MVNO access must be approved by the CRTC, while \\nrates will be subject to commercia l negotiation, backstopped by \\nfinal offer arbitration, with the CRTC acting as arbitrator. Mandated \\nMVNO access will be limited to a seven-year period commencing \\non the date the CRTC finalizes the terms and conditions. This time \\nlimit is intended to provide the regional carriers sufficient time to \\nexpand their networks while maintaining investment incentives. \\nThe\\n national wireless carriers must also provide seamless handoff as \\npart of the mandatory roaming they must offer to the regional \\nwireless carriers. Seamless handoff will ensure that calls in progress \\nare not dropped when customers travel outside their home \\nnetwork coverage and into the coverage of their roaming provider. \\nThe CRTC also directed the national wireless carriers to offer 5G \\nroaming where the roaming network offers 5G service on its own \\nnetwork and to file proposed revised terms and conditions within \\n90 days for CRTC approval. The CRTC also mandated retail rate \\nplans for low-cost and occasional use. These plans were \\nimplemented on July 14, 2021. \\nOn April 6, 2022, the CRTC issued Telecom Decision CRTC \\n2022-102, Updates to national wireless carriers’ GSM-based \\nwholesale mobile wireless roaming tariffs to incorporate seamless \\nhand-off and 5G roaming, which requires the implementation of \\nseamless roaming, including using one-way seamless hand-off. The \\nCRTC directed the national wireless carriers to begin accepting \\nwritten requests for seamless ro aming from regional wireless \\ncarriers effective immediately. The CRTC considers that its \\ndeterminations in this decision will assist with the implementation \\nof seamless roaming to the benefit of regional wireless carriers and \\nreduce barriers to entry into the market and to competition for \\ntelecommunications service providers that are new, regional, or \\nsmaller than the incumbent national service providers. \\nOn\\n October 19, 2022, the CRTC issued Telecom Decision CRTC \\n2022-288, Facilities-based wholesale mobile virtual network \\noperator (MVNO) access tariffs – Commission determinations on \\nproposed terms and conditions, which determined that wholesale \\nMVNO access service is available for use by regional wireless \\ncarriers that have deployed their own home Public Mobile Network \\n(PMN) somewhere in Canada and ar e also offering retail wireless \\nservices.

On September 11, 2023, the \\nMinister of Innovation, Science and Industry announced new \\nspectrum licence conditions, which required carriers to (i) provide \\nequivalent levels of service to all TTC subway riders by October 3, \\n2023; (ii) expand existing network coverage in order to provide full \\nvoice, text, and data services throughout the TTC subway system \\nwithin specific timeframes; and (iii) provide service in all future \\nstations and tunnels at the same time as they are made operational \\nby the TTC. On October 2, 2023, we announced we had \\ndeveloped and introduced an immediate solution to activate 5G \\nservice for transit riders from all major Canadian wireless carriers in \\nthe busiest sections of the TTC subway system. \\nGOVERNMENT OF CANADA BUDGET 2023 \\nThe 2023 Federal Budget, published in March 2023, includes a \\nplan to address specific fees (including unexpected, hidden, and \\nadditional fees) to continue to ensure businesses are transparent \\nwith prices and to make life more affordable for Canadians.

The \\nCRTC intends to provide greater regulatory certainty to those \\nseeking access to ILEC-owned or -controlled support structures \\nand to promote the efficient deployment of wireless networks, \\nincluding 5G-capable networks. In particular, the CRTC is \\nexamining whether it should modify existing rules that allow third \\nparties to attach 5G small cells . The CRTC concurrently denied \\napplications by Rogers seeking interim and final orders directing \\nBell and Telus to process and grant permits to attach wireless \\nequipment in accordance with their approved support structure \\ntariffs.

The CRTC determined that wholesale \\nhigh-speed access services, which are used to support retail \\ncompetition for services, such as local phone, television, and \\nInternet access, would continue to be mandated. The provision of \\nprovincially aggregated services, however, would no longer be \\nmandated and would be phased out in conjunction with the \\nimplementation of a disaggregated service with connections at \\ntelephone company central offices and cable company head-ends. \\nThe requirement to implement disaggregated wholesale high-\\nspeed access services will include making them available over \\nfibre-to-the-premises (FTTP) access facilities.

The CRTC had requested comments on several issues, \\nincluding the preliminary views that (i) the provision of aggregated \\nwholesale HSA services should be mandated; (ii) access to FTTH \\nfacilities should be provided over these services; and (iii) the \\nprovision of FTTH facilities over aggregated wholesale HSA services \\nshould be mandated on a temporary and expedited basis until the \\nCRTC reaches a decision as to whether such access is to be \\nprovided indefinitely. \\nOn\\n November 6, 2023, the CRTC released Telecom Decision \\nCRTC 2023-358, mandating the incumbent local exchange carriers \\nto provide competitors with access to their FTTH facilities over \\naggregated wholesale HSA in Quebec and Ontario by May 7, \\n2024. The CRTC found that the hybrid fibre-coaxial networks of \\ncable carriers, such as Rogers, already service the majority of \\nwholesale-based competitors and concluded that, given the \\ntemporary nature of the aggregated FTTH access mandate being \\nconsidered, it would be neither efficient nor proportionate to \\nmandate cable carriers to implement it.

On December 15, 2023, the \\nGovernment of Canada released the final regulations establishing \\nthe factors that determine if the Online News Act applies to a \\ndigital platform and when it is required to notify the CRTC. The \\nregulations direct the CRTC on how to determine if a digital \\nplatform qualifies for an exemption from mandatory bargaining \\nand final offer arbitration. Digital platforms that operate a search \\nengine or social media service in Canada are captured if they \\ndistribute news in Canada and have total global revenues of \\n$1 billion or more and 20 million or more Canadian users/visitors. \\nThe total amount that can be received by broadcasters has been  \\ncapped\\n at no more than 30% and will be administered by the \\nCanadian Association of Broadcasters. \\nBy early March 2024, the CRTC is expected to launch its public \\nconsultation on the formal bargaining process, undue preference, \\nand information gathering. In Spring 2024, we expect the CRTC \\nwill issue a call for proposals for an independent auditor, who will \\nprepare an annual report on the impact of the Act on Canada’s \\ndigital news marketplace. In Summer or Fall 2024, we expect CRTC \\ndecisions setting out the regulatory framework and a public \\nconsultation to establish a code of conduct for bargaining. The \\nCRTC will also recruit qualified independent arbitrators and begin \\nfurther information gathering.

The CRTC did \\nnot relax its common ownership policy that relates to the number of \\nradio stations that can be commonly owned (4) in markets served by \\nmore than 8 commercial radio stations but did make minor \\nmodifications to AM/FM band restrictions to now allow ownership of \\n3 FM stations in a market.

Significant \\nchanges in our assumptions, including those related to our future \\nbusiness plans and cash flows, could materially change the \\namounts we record.

We may need to use \\nadditional judgment because of the sensitivity of the methods and \\nassumptions used in determining the asset, liability, revenue, and \\nexpense amounts. \\nESTIMATES \\nREVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS \\nDetermining the transaction price \\nThe transaction price is the amount of consideration that is \\nenforceable and to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for \\nthe goods and services we have promised to our customer. We \\ndetermine the transaction price by considering the terms of the \\ncontract and business practices that are customary within that \\nparticular line of business. Discounts, rebates, refunds, credits, price \\nconcessions, incentives, penaltie s, and other similar items are \\nreflected in the transaction price at contract inception. \\nDetermining\\n the stand-alone selling price and the allocation of the \\ntransaction price \\nThe transaction price is allocated to performance obligations based \\non the relative stand-alone selling prices of the distinct goods or \\nservices in the contract. The best evidence of a stand-alone selling \\nprice is the observable price of a good or service when the entity \\nsells that good or service separately in similar circumstances and to \\nsimilar customers. If a stand-alone selling price is not directly \\nobservable, we estimate the stand-alone selling price taking into \\naccount reasonably available information relating to the market \\nconditions, entity-specific factors, and the class of customer. \\nIn determining the stand-alone selling price, we allocate revenue \\nbetween performance obligations based on expected minimum \\nenforceable amounts to which we are entitled. Any amounts above \\nthe minimum enforceable amounts are recognized as revenue as \\nthey are earned. \\nLEASES \\nWe estimate the lease term by considering the facts and \\ncircumstances that can create an economic incentive to exercise an \\nextension option, or not exercise a termination option. We make \\ncertain qualitative and quantitative assumptions when deriving the \\nvalue of the economic incentive. \\nUSEFUL LIVES \\nWe depreciate the cost of property, plant and equipment over their \\nestimated useful lives by considering industry trends and company-\\nspecific factors, including changing technologies and expectations \\nfor the in-service period of certain assets at the time. We reassess \\nour estimates of useful lives annually, or when circumstances \\nchange, to ensure they match the anticipated life of the technology \\nfrom a revenue-producing perspective. If technological change \\nhappens more quickly, or in a diffe rent way, than anticipated, we \\nmight have to reduce the estimated life of property, plant and \\nequipment, which could result in a higher depreciation expense in \\nf u t u r e  p e r i o d s  o r  a n  i m p a i r m e n t  c h a r g e  t o  w r i t e d o w n t h e v a l u e . \\nWe monitor and review our depreciation rates and asset useful lives \\nat least once a year and change them if they are different from our \\nprevious estimates.

The \\ncapitalized amounts are calculated based on estimated costs of \\nprojects that are capital in natu re, and are generally based on a \\nper-hour rate. In addition, inte rest costs are capitalized during \\ndevelopment and construction of certain property, plant and \\nequipment. Capitalized amounts increase the cost of the asset and \\nresult in a higher depreciation expense in future periods. \\nIMPAIRMENT OF ASSETS \\nIndefinite-life intangible assets (including goodwill and spectrum \\nand/or broadcast licences) are assessed for impairment on an \\nannual basis, or more often if events or circumstances warrant, and \\nfinite-life assets (including property, plant and equipment and \\nother intangible assets) are assessed for impairment if events or \\ncircumstances warrant.

We measure stock-based compensation to employees at \\nfair value. We determine the fair value of options using our Class B \\nNon-Voting Share price and option pricing models, and record all \\noutstanding stock options as liabilities. The liability is marked to \\nmarket each period and is amortized to expense using a graded \\nvesting approach over the period during which employee services \\nare rendered, or over the period to the date an employee is \\neligible to retire, whichever is shorter. The expense in each period \\nis affected by the change in the price of our Class B Non-Voting \\nShares during the period. \\nRestricted share unit (RSU) and deferred share unit (DSU) plans \\nWe recognize outstanding RSUs and DSUs as\\n liabilities, measuring \\nthe liabilities and compensation costs based on the awards’ fair \\nvalues, which are based on the market price of the Class B \\nNon-Voting Shares, and recognizing them as charges to \\n“operating costs” over the vesting period of the awards.

We believe \\nthese key performance indicators allow us to appropriately \\nmeasure our performance  agains t our operating strategy and \\nagainst the results of our peers and competitors. The following key \\nperformance indicators, some of which are supplementary financial \\nmeasures (see “Non-GAAP and Other Financial Measures”), are not \\nmeasurements in accordance with IFRS. They include: \\n• subscriber counts; \\n• Wireless; \\n• Cable; and \\n• homes passed (Cable); \\n• Wireless subscriber churn (churn); \\n• Wireless mobile phone average revenue per user (ARPU); \\n• Cable average revenue per account (ARPA); \\n• Cable customer relationships; \\n• Cable market penetration (penetration); \\n• capital intensity; \\n• total service revenue; \\n• dividend payout ratios; and \\n• return on assets. \\nSUBSCRIBER COUNTS \\nWe determine the number of subscribers to our services based on \\nactive subscribers. When subscr ibers are deactivated, either \\nvoluntarily or involuntarily for no n-payment, they are considered \\ndeactivations in the period the services are discontinued. We use \\nsubscriber counts to measure our core business performance and \\nability to benefit from recurring revenue streams. We use homes \\npassed (Cable) as a measure for our potential market penetration \\nwithin a defined geographical area. \\nSubscriber count (Wireless) \\n• A wireless subscriber is represented by each identifiable \\ntelephone number. \\n• We report wireless subscribers in two categories: postpaid \\nmobile phone and prepaid mobile phone. Postpaid and \\nprepaid include voice-only subscribers and subscribers with \\nservice plans including both voice and data. \\n• Usage and overage charges for postpaid subscribers are billed a \\nmonth in arrears. Prepaid subscribers cannot incur usage and/or \\noverage charges in excess of their plan limits or account balance. \\n• Wireless prepaid subscribers are considered active for a period \\nof 30 days from the date of their last revenue-generating usage. \\nSubscriber count (Cable) \\n• Cable retail Internet, Video, and Smart Home Monitoring \\nsubscribers are represented by a dwelling unit; Cable Home \\nPhone subscribers are represented by line counts. \\n• When there is more than one unit in a single dwelling, such as an \\napartment building, each tenant with cable service is counted as \\nan individual subscriber, whether the service is invoiced \\nseparately or included in the te nant’s rent. Institutional units, \\nsuch as hospitals or hotels, are each considered one subscriber. \\n• Cable retail Internet, Video, Smart Home Monitoring, and Home \\nPhone subscribers include only those subscribers who have \\nservice installed and operati ng, and who are being billed \\naccordingly. \\n• Subscriber counts exclude satellite subscribers, certain business \\nservices delivered over our fibre network and data centre \\ninfrastructure, and circuit-switched local and long distance voice \\nservices and legacy data services where access is delivered using \\nleased third-party network elements and tariffed ILEC services.'),\n",

Churn \\nmeasures our success in retaining our subscribers. We calculate it by \\ndividing the number of Wireless subscribers that deactivated (usually \\nin a  month) by the aggregate numbers of subscribers at the \\nbeginning of the period. When used or reported for a period greater \\nthan one month, churn represents the sum of the number of \\nsubscribers deactivating for each period divided by the sum of the \\naggregate number of subscribers at the beginning of each period. \\nMOBILE PHONE AVERAGE REVENUE PER USER (WIRELESS) \\nMobile phone ARPU helps us identify trends and measure our \\nsuccess in attracting and retaining higher-value subscribers. Mobile \\nphone ARPU is a supplementary financial measure. See \\n“Non-GAAP and Other Financial Measures” for an explanation as to \\nthe composition of this measure. \\nAVERAGE REVENUE PER ACCOUNT (CABLE) \\nAverage revenue per account (ARPA) measures total average \\nspending by a single customer account on Cable products. We use \\nit to identify trends and measure our success in attracting and \\nretaining multiple-service accounts. ARPA is also a supplementary \\nfinancial measure. See “Non-GAAP and Other Financial Measures” \\nfor an explanation as to the composition of this measure. \\nCUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS \\nCustomer relationships are represented by dwelling units where at \\nleast one of our Cable services (i.e. retail Internet, legacy television \\nor Ignite TV, and/or home phone) are installed and operating, and \\nthe service or services are billed accordingly. When there is more \\nthan one unit in one dwelling, such as an apartment building, each \\ntenant with at least one of our Cable services is counted as  an \\nindividual customer relationship, whether the service is invoiced \\nseparately or included in the tenant’s rent. Institutional units, like \\nhospitals or hotels, are each considered one customer relationship. \\n2023 ANNUAL REPORT ROGERS COMMUNICATIONS INC. | 82'),\n",

Market penetr ation is calculated by dividing \\ncustomer relationships by home s passed. An increasing market \\npenetration rate reflects more new customer relationships than \\nnew homes passed. \\nCAPITAL INTENSITY \\nCapital intensity allows us to compare the level of our capital \\nexpenditures to that of other companies within the same industry. \\nOur capital expenditures do not include expenditures on spectrum \\nlicences or additions to right-of-use assets. We use it to evaluate the \\nperformance of our assets and when making decisions about \\ncapital expenditures. We believe that certain investors and analysts \\nuse capital intensity to meas ure the performance of asset \\npurchases and construction in relation to revenue. Capital intensity \\nis also a  supplementary financial measure. See “Non-GAAP and \\nOther Financial Measures” for an explanation as to the composition \\nof this measure. \\nTOTAL SERVICE REVENUE \\nWe use total service revenue to measure our core business \\nperformance from the provision of services to our customers \\nseparate from revenue generated from the sale of equipment we \\nhave acquired from device manufacturers and resold. Included in \\nthis metric is our retail revenue from Today’s Shopping Choice and \\nthe Toronto Blue Jays, which are also core to our business. We \\ncalculate total service revenue by subtracting equipment revenue \\nfrom total revenue. \\nDIVIDEND PAYOUT RATIOS \\nWe calculate the dividend payout ratio by dividing dividends \\ndeclared for the year by net income or free cash flow for the year. \\nWe use dividends as a  percentage of net income and free cash \\nflow to conduct analysis and assist with determining the dividends \\nwe should pay. Dividend payout ratio of net income and dividend \\npayout ratio of free cash flow are also supplementary financial \\nmeasures. See “Non-GAAP and Other Financial Measures” for an \\nexplanation as to the composition of these measures. \\nRETURN ON ASSETS \\nWe use return on assets to measure our efficiency in using our \\nassets to generate net income. Return on assets is also a \\nsupplementary financial measure.

Our responsibility is to express an \\nopinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our \\naudits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB \\nand are required to be independent with respect to the Company \\nin accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the \\napplicable rules and regulations of the  Securities and Exchange \\nCommission and the PCAOB. \\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the \\nPCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the \\naudit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the \\nconsolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, \\nwhether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing \\nprocedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the \\nconsolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, \\nand performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such \\nprocedures included examining, on a  test basis, evidence \\nregarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated \\nfinancial statements.

Goodwill is impaired if the recoverable amount of a \\ncash-generating unit (CGU) or group of cash-generating units \\n(CGUs) that contain goodwill is less than the carrying amount. The \\nCompany makes judgments in determining CGUs and the \\nallocation of goodwill for the purpose of impairment testing. \\nGoodwill is monitored at an operating segment level in the Media \\nsegment. The goodwill balance in the Media  segment as  of \\nDecember 31, 2023 was $969 million. A number of businesses \\nwithin the  Company’s Media segment are partially reliant on \\ntraditional advertising revenues, are subject to a highly competitive \\nenvironment and continue to have profitability challenges due to \\ndeclining advertising revenue growth rates and increasing costs of \\nproducing and/or providing content. The estimate of the \\nrecoverable amount, which is determined based on the fair value \\nless costs to sell using disco unted cash flow and market \\napproaches, is based on significa nt estimates developed by the \\nCompany relating to future cash flows, the terminal growth rate, \\nand the discount rate applied in its valuation model. \\nWe identified the assessment of the recoverability of the carrying \\nvalue of goodwill in the  Media segment as a critical audit matter. \\nThere were judgments applied in assessing the level at which \\ngoodwill was tested and there was a  high degree of subjective \\nauditor judgment required in evaluating the key assumptions used \\nin the valuation models, which included the CGUs’ future cash \\nflows, the discount rate and the terminal growth rate. \\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address \\nthis critical audit matter.

A high degree of \\nauditor judgment was required to evaluate the key assumptions of \\nthe revenue growth rates included in the expected cash flow that \\nwould be provided by each subscriber and the discount rate used \\nto estimate the fair value of the cable customer relationships \\nintangible assets, due to sensitivity of the valuation of the intangible \\nassets to changes in these assumptions. Additionally, the audit \\neffort associated with the discount rate assumption required \\nspecialized skills and knowledge. \\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address \\nthis critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the \\noperating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the \\nCompany’s determination of the estimated fair value of the \\nacquired cable customer relationships intangible assets, including \\ncontrols over the determination of the key assumptions.

RCI refers \\nto the legal entity Rogers Communications Inc., not including its \\nsubsidiaries. Rogers also holds interests in various investments and \\nventures. \\nWe report our results of operations in three reportable segments. \\nEach segment and the nature of its business is as follows: \\nSegment Principal activities \\nWireless Wireless telecommunications operations \\nfor Canadian consumers and businesses. \\nCable Cable telecommunications operations, \\nincluding Internet, television and other \\nvideo (Video), Satellite, telephony (Home \\nPhone), and smart home monitoring \\nservices for Canadian consumers and \\nbusinesses, and network connectivity \\nthrough our fibre network and data centre \\nassets to support a range of voice, data, \\nnetworking, hosting, and cloud-based \\nservices for the business, public sector, \\nand carrier wholesale markets. \\nMedia A diversified portfolio of media properties, \\nincluding sports media and entertainment, \\ntelevision and radio broadcasting, \\nspecialty channels, multi-platform \\nshopping, and digital media. \\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, Wireless and Cable \\nwere operated by our wholly owned subsidiary, Rogers \\nCommunications Canada Inc. (RCCI ), and certain other wholly \\nowned subsidiaries. Media was operated by our wholly owned \\nsubsidiary, Rogers Media Inc., an d its subsidiaries. Following the \\nacquisition of Shaw Communications Inc.

This means our results in one quarter are not necessarily \\nindicative of how we will perform in a future quarter.

Fluctuations in net income from quarter to \\nquarter can also be attributed to losses on the repayment of debt, \\nother income and expenses, impair ment of assets, restructuring, \\nacquisition and other costs, and changes in income tax expense. \\nThe acquired Shaw business has substantially consistent \\nfluctuations as our Cable business. \\nWireless \\nWireless operating results are influenced by the timing of our \\nmarketing and promotional \\nexpenditures and higher levels of \\nsubscriber additions, resulting in higher subscriber acquisition- and \\nactivation-related expenses, typi cally in the third and fourth \\nquarters. The third and fourth quarters typically experience higher \\nvolumes of activity as a result of “back to school” and holiday \\nseason-related consumer behaviour. Aggressive promotional offers \\nare often advertised during these periods. In contrast, we typically \\nsee lower subscriber-related activity in the first quarter of the year. \\n97 | ROGERS COMMUNICATIONS INC. 2023 ANNUAL REPORT'),\n",

Highly anticipated device launches typically occur in the \\nspring and fall seasons of each year. Wireless roaming revenue is \\ndependent on customer travel volumes and timing, which in turn \\nare affected by the foreign exchange rate of the Canadian dollar \\nand general economic conditions. \\nCable \\nCable ope\\nrating results are affected by modest seasonal \\nfluctuations, typically caused by: \\n• university and college students who live in temporary\\n residences: \\n• moving out early in the second quarter and canceling their \\nservice; and \\n• students moving in late in the third quarter and signing up for \\ncable service; \\n• individuals temporarily suspending wireline service for extended \\nvacations or seasonal relocations; \\n• individuals temporarily activating satellite services for second or \\nvacation homes during the second and third quarter; \\n• the timing of service pricing changes; and \\n• the concentrated marketing we generally conduct in our fourth \\nquarter. \\nCable results from our enterprise customers do not generally have \\nany unique seasonal aspects. \\nMedia \\nSeasonal fluctuations relate to:  \\n• p\\neriods of increased consumer activity and their impact on \\nadvertising and related retail cycles, which tend to be most active \\nin the fourth quarter due to holiday spending and slower in the \\nfirst quarter; \\n• the Major League Baseball season, where: \\n• games played are concentrated in the spring, summer, and \\nfall months (generally the second and third quarters of the \\nyear); \\n• revenue related to game day ticket sales, merchandise sales, \\nand advertising is concentrated when games are played, with \\npostseason games commanding a premium in advertising \\nrevenue and additional revenue from game day ticket sales \\nand merchandise sales, if and when the Toronto Blue Jays play \\nin the postseason (in the fourth quarter of the year); and \\n• programming and production costs and player payroll are \\nexpensed based on the number of games aired or played, as \\napplicable; and \\n• the National Hockey League (NHL) season, where: \\n• regular season games are concentrated in the fall and winter \\nmonths (generally the first and fourth quarters of the year) and \\nplayoff games are concentrated in the spring months \\n(generally the second quarter of the year). We expect a \\ncorrelation between the quality of revenue and earnings and \\nthe extent of Canadian teams’ presence during the playoffs; \\n• programming and production costs are expensed based on\\n \\nthe timing of when the rights are aired or are expected to be \\nconsumed; and \\n• advertising revenue and programming expenses are \\nconcentrated when games are played, with playoff games \\ncommanding a premium in advertising revenue. \\nSTATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE \\nWe prepared our consolidated financial statements in accordance \\nwith International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the \\nInternational Accounting Standards Board (IASB).

Assistance related to \\nexpenses is recognized as a redu ction of the related expense; \\nassistance related to assets is recognized as a reduction to the \\ncarrying amount of the asset. During the year ended December 31, \\n2023, we recognized $111 million (2022 – $43 million) in network \\ncapital expenditure-related gove rnment grants and received \\n$59 million (2022 – $23 million) in cash. \\nDuring 2022, we signed an agreement with Canada Infrastructure \\nBank for a 30-year, $665 million senior unsecured non-revolving \\nfacility with a below-market interest rate (see note 23). In 2023, we \\namended the terms of the facility to, among other things, increase \\nthe limit to $815 million. The benefit of a below-market loan from a \\ngovernment entity is accounted for as a government grant and is \\nequal to the difference between (i) the present value of the cash \\nflows at the time of borrowing based on a market interest rate and \\n(ii) the proceeds received. We recognize the difference within \\n“other current liabilities” (when the grant will be recognized within \\none year of the date of the financial statements) or “other long-\\nterm liabilities” on our Consol idated Statements of Financial \\nPosition. The liability is subsequently measured at amortized cost \\nusing the effective interest method. The interest expense on the \\nliability will be represented by the accretion of the loan liability over \\ntime. The government grant will be recognized as a reduction of \\nthe interest expense over the term of the loan. We have not \\nrecognized a government grant liability related to this loan as at \\nDecember 31, 2023 as we have not yet borrowed against this \\nfacility. \\n(e) ASSETS HELD FOR SALE \\nWe classify non-current assets, or disposal groups consisting of \\nassets and liabilities, as held-for-sale  if it is highly probable their \\ncarrying amounts will be recovered primarily through a sale rather \\nthan through continued use. Assets, or disposal groups, classified \\nas held-for-sale are  measured at the  lower of (i) their carrying \\namount and (ii) fair value less costs to sell. Once classified as \\nheld-for-sale, property, plant and equipment and finite-life \\nintangible assets are no longe r depreciated or amortized, \\nrespectively. Classifying assets or disposal groups as held for sale \\ncan require significant judgment in determining if the sale is highly \\nprobable, especially for larger assets or disposal groups. This \\nrequires an assessment of, among other things, whether \\nmanagement is committed to the sale and it is unlikely significant \\nchanges to the disposal plan will be made. \\n(f) NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS ADOPTED IN \\n2023 \\nWe adopted the following IFRS amendments in 2023. They did not \\nhave a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. \\n• IFRS 17, Insurance Contracts, a replacement of IFRS 4, Insurance \\nContracts, that aims to provide consistency in the application of \\naccounting for insurance contracts. \\n• Amendments to IAS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements – \\nDisclosure of Accounting Policies, requiring entities to disclose \\nmaterial, instead of significant, accounting policy information. \\nThe accounting policies disclo sed within these financial \\nstatements were not impacted by the adoption of these \\namendments. \\n• Amendments to IAS 8, Accounting Policies – Changes in \\nAccounting Estimates and Errors, clarifying the definition of \\n“accounting policies” and “accounting estimates”.'),\n",

We possess control over an entity when we \\nconclude we are exposed to variable returns from our involvement \\nwith the acquired entity and we have the ability to affect those \\nreturns through our power over the acquired entity. \\nWe calculate the fair value of the consideration paid as the sum of \\nthe fair value at the date of acquisition of the assets we transferred, \\nthe equity interests we issued, an d the liabilities we incurred to \\nformer owners of the subsidiary. \\nWe measure goodwill as the fair value of the consideration \\ntransferred less the net recognize d amount of the identifiable \\nassets acquired and liabilities assumed, which are generally \\nmeasured at fair value as of the acquisition date. When the excess \\nis negative, a gain on acquisition is recognized immediately in net \\nincome. \\nWe expense the transaction costs a ssociated with acquisitions as \\nwe incur them. \\nESTIMATES \\nWe use estimates in determining the value of assets acquired and \\nliabilities assumed in business combinations, most significantly \\nproperty, plant and equipment and intangible assets, including the \\nrelated deferred tax impacts. \\nJUDGMENTS \\nWe use significant judgment to determine what is, and what is not, \\npart of a business combination, including the timing of when \\ncontrol transfers to us. This requires assessing the nature of other \\ntransactions entered into with the acquiree to ensure we account \\nfor the business combination using only the consideration \\ntransferred for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the \\nexchange. \\nWe also use significant judgment in determining the valuation \\nmethodologies applied to various assets and liabilities. \\n2023 ANNUAL REPORT ROGERS COMMUNICATIONS INC. | 100'),\n",

To maintain or adjust our capital \\nstructure, we may, with approval from the Board as necessary, issue \\nor repay debt and/or short-term borrowings, issue or repurchase \\nshares, pay dividends, or undertake other activities as deemed \\nappropriate under the circumstances. The Board reviews and \\napproves the annual capital and operating budgets, as well as any \\nmaterial transactions that are not part of the ordinary course of \\nbusiness, including proposals for acquisitions or other major \\nfinancing transactions, investments, or divestitures. \\nThe wholly owned subsidiary through which our credit card \\nprograms are operated is regulated by the Office of the \\nSuperintendent of Financial Institutions, which requires a minimum \\nlevel of regulatory capital be maintained. Our subsidiary was in \\ncompliance with that requirement as at December 31, 2023 and \\n2022. The capital requirements are not material to us as at \\nDecember 31, 2023 or December 31, 2022. \\nWith the exception of our credit card programs and the subsidiary \\nthrough which they are operated, we are not subject to externally \\nimposed capital requirements. \\nKEY METRICS AND RATIOS \\nWe monitor adjusted net debt, debt leverage ratio, free cash flow, \\nand available liquidity to manage our capital structure and related \\nrisks.

A summary of our key metrics and \\nratios follows, along with a reco nciliation between each of these \\nmeasures and the items presented in the consolidated financial \\nstatements. \\nAdjusted net debt and debt leverage ratio \\nWe monitor adjusted net debt and de bt leverage ratio as part of  \\nthe management of liquidity to sustain future development of our \\nbusiness, conduct valuation-related analyses, and make decisions \\nabout capital. In so doing, we typically aim to have an adjusted net \\ndebt and debt leverage ratio that allow us to maintain investment-\\ngrade credit ratings, which allows us the associated access to \\ncapital markets.

They review adjusted EBITDA as the \\nkey measure of profit for the purpose of assessing performance of \\neach segment and to make decisions about the allocation of \\nresources, as they believe adjusted EBITDA reflects segment and \\nconsolidated profitability. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as income \\nbefore depreciation and amortization; (gain) loss on disposition of \\nproperty, plant and equipment; restructuring, acquisition and \\nother; finance costs; other expense (income); and income tax \\nexpense. \\nWe follow the same accounting policies for our segments as those \\ndescribed in the notes to our co nsolidated financial statements. \\nWe account for transactions between reportable segments in the \\nsame way we account for transactio ns with external parties, but \\neliminate them on consolidation. \\nJUDGMENTS \\nWe make significant judgments in determining our operating \\nsegments. These are components that engage in business activities \\nfrom which they may earn revenue and incur expenses, for which \\noperating results are regularly reviewed by our chief operating \\ndecision maker to make decisions about resources to be allocated \\nand assess component performanc e, and for which discrete \\nfinancial information is available. \\nREPORTABLE SEGMENTS \\nOur reportable segments are Wireless, Cable, and Media (see note \\n1).

We also determine whether a customer \\ncan modify their contract within predefined terms such that we are \\nnot able to enforce the transactio n price agreed to, but can only \\ncontractually enforce a lower amount. In situations such as these, \\nwe allocate revenue between pe rformance obligations using the \\nminimum enforceable rights and obligations and any excess \\namount is recognized as revenue as it is earned. \\nRevenue for each performance obligation is recognized either over \\ntime (e.g. services) or at a point in time (e.g. equipment). For \\nperformance obligations satisfied over time, revenue is recognized \\nas the services are provided. These services are typically provided, \\nand thus revenue is typically re cognized, on a monthly basis. \\nRevenue for performance obligations satisfied at a point in time is \\nrecognized when control of the item (or service) transfers to the \\ncustomer. Typically, this is when the customer activates the goods \\n(e.g. in the case of a wireless device) or has physical possession of \\nthe goods (e.g. other equipment). \\n107 | ROGERS COMMUNICATIONS INC. 2023 ANNUAL REPORT'),\n",

We \\ndetermine the transaction price by  considering the terms of the \\ncontract and business practices th at are  customary  within that \\nparticular line of business. Discounts, rebates, refunds, credits, price \\nconcessions, incentives, penalties, and other similar items are \\nreflected in the transaction price at contract inception. \\nDetermining the stand-alone selling price and the allocation of the \\ntransaction price \\nThe transaction price is allocated to performance obligations based \\non the relative stand-alone selling prices of the distinct goods or \\nservices in the contract. The best evidence of a stand-alone selling \\nprice is the observable price of a good or service when the entity \\nsells that good or service separately in similar circumstances and to \\nsimilar customers. If a stand-al one selling price is not directly \\nobservable, we estimate the stand-alone selling price taking into \\naccount reasonably available information relating to the  market \\nconditions, entity-specific factors, and the class of customer. \\nIn determining the stand-alone selling price, we allocate revenue \\nbetween performance obligations based on expected minimum \\nenforceable amounts to which we are entitled. Any amounts above \\nthe minimum enforceable amounts are recognized as revenue as \\nthey are earned. \\nJUDGMENTS \\nWe make significant judgments in determining whether a promise \\nto deliver goods or services is considered distinct and in \\ndetermining whether our residual value arrangements constitute \\nrevenue-generating arrangements or leases. \\nDistinct goods and services \\nWe make judgments in determining whether a promise to deliver \\ngoods or services is considered distinct. We account for individual \\nproducts and services separately if they are distinct (i.e. if a product \\nor service is separately identifiable from other items in the bundled \\npackage and if the customer can benefit from it). The consideration \\nis allocated between separate products and services in a bundle \\nbased on their stand-alone selling prices. For distinct items we do \\nnot sell separately, we estimate stand-alone selling prices using the \\nadjusted market assessment approach. \\nResidual value arrangements \\nUnder certain customer offers, we allow customers to defer a \\ncomponent of the device cost unt il contract termination. We use \\njudgment in determining whether these arrangements constitute \\nrevenue-generating arrangements or leases. In making this \\ndetermination, we use judgment to assess the extent of control \\nover the devices that passes to our customer, including whether the \\ncustomer has a significant economic incentive at contract inception \\nto return the device at contract termination and to estimate the \\nextent of device returns. \\nCONTRACT ASSETS \\nBelow is a summary of our contra ct assets from contracts with \\ncustomers, net of an allowance for doubtful accounts, and the \\nsignificant changes in those balances during the years ended \\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022. \\nYears ended December 31 \\n(In millions of dollars) Note 2023 2022 \\nBalance, beginning of year 197 204 \\nAdditions from new contracts \\nwith customers, net of \\nterminations and renewals 204 121 \\nContract assets acquired 3 35 – \\nAmortization of contract assets \\nto accounts receivable (160) (128) \\nBalance, end of year 276 197 \\nCurrent 163 111 \\nLong-term 113 86 \\nBalance, end of year 276 197 \\nCONTRACT LIABILITIES \\nBelow is a summary of our contract liabilities from contracts with \\ncustomers and the significant changes in those balances during the \\nyears ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. \\nYears ended December 31 \\n(In millions of dollars) Note 2023 2022 \\nBalance, beginning of year 461 446 \\nContract liabilities assumed 3 164 – \\nRevenue deferred in previous'),\n",

Subsequently, property, plant \\nand equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation \\nand accumulated impairment losses. \\nCost includes expenditures (capital expenditures) that are directly \\nattributable to the acquisition of the asset.

A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract \\nconveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a \\nperiod of time in exchange for consideration. To assess whether a \\ncontract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, \\nwe assess whether: \\n• the contract involves the use of an identified asset; \\n• we have the right to obtain substantially all of the economic \\nbenefits from use of the identified asset throughout the period \\nof use; and \\n• we have the right to direct the use of the asset. \\nLESSEE ACCOUNTING \\nWe record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease \\ncommencement date. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at \\ncost, consisting of: \\n• the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease \\npayments made at or before the commencement date; plus \\n• any initial direct costs incurred; and \\n• an estimate of costs to dismantle and remove the underlying \\nasset or restore the site on which it is located; less \\n• any lease incentives received. \\nThe right-of-use asset is depreciated on a straight-line basis over \\nthe lease term, unless we expect to obtain ownership of the leased \\nasset at the end of the lease. The lease term consists of: \\n• the non-cancellable period of the lease; \\n• periods covered by options to extend the lease, where we are \\nreasonably certain to exercise the option; and \\n• periods covered by options to terminate the lease, where we are \\nreasonably certain not to exercise the option. \\nIf we expect to obtain ownership of the leased asset at the end of \\nthe lease, we depreciate the right-of-use asset over the underlying \\nasset’s estimated useful life. In addition, the right-of-use asset is \\nperiodically reduced by impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for \\ncertain remeasurements of the lease liability. \\nThe lease liability is initially measured at the present value of lease \\npayments that are not paid at the commencement date, \\ndiscounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate \\ncannot be readily determined, our incremental borrowing rate. We \\ngenerally use our incremental borrowing rate as the interest rate \\nimplicit in our leases cannot be readily determined. The lease \\nliability is subsequently measured at amortized cost using the \\neffective interest rate method. \\nLease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability \\ninclude: \\n• fixed payments, including in-substance fixed payments; \\n• variable lease payments that depend on an index or rate; \\n• amounts expected to be payable under a residual value \\nguarantee; and \\n• the exercise price under a purchase option that we are \\nreasonably certain to exercise, lease payments in an optional \\nrenewal period if we are reasonably certain to exercise an \\nextension option, and penalties for early termination of a lease \\nunless we are reasonably certain not to terminate early. \\nThe lease liability is remeasured when there is a change in future \\nlease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, if there is \\na change in our estimate of the amount expected to be payable \\nunder a residual value guarantee, or if we change our assessment \\nof whether or not we will exercise a purchase, extension, or \\ntermination option. When the lease liability is remeasured in this \\nway, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount \\nof the right-of-use asset. The lease liability is also remeasured when \\nthe underlying lease contract is amended. \\nWe have elected not to separate fixed non-lease components and \\naccount for the lease and any fixed non-lease components as a \\nsingle lease component. \\nVariable lease payments \\nCertain leases contain provisions t h a t r e s u l t i n d i f f e r i n g l e a s e \\npayments over the term as a result of market rate reviews or'),\n",

These non-rental costs \\nare typically variable and are not included in the calculation of the \\nright-of-use asset or lease liability. \\nLESSOR ACCOUNTING \\nWhen we act as a lessor, we determine at lease inception whether \\neach lease is a finance lease or an operating lease. \\nIn order to classify each lease as either finance or operating, we \\nmake an overall assessment of whether the lease transfers to the \\nlessee substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental to \\nownership of the underlying asset. If it does, the lease is a finance \\nlease; if not, it is an operating lease. \\nWe act as the lessor on certain collocation leases, whereby, due to \\ncertain regulatory requirements, we must allow other \\ntelecommunication companies to lease space on our wireless \\nnetwork towers. We do not believe we transfer substantially all of \\nthe risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the underlying \\nleased asset to the lessee and therefore classify these leases as \\noperating leases. \\nIf an arrangement contains both lease and non-lease components, \\nwe apply IFRS 15 to allocate the consideration in the contract \\nbetween the lease and the non-lease components. \\nWe recognize lease payments received under operating leases into \\nincome on a straight-line basis. \\nESTIMATES \\nWe estimate the lease term by considering the facts and \\ncircumstances that can create an economic incentive to exercise an \\nextension option, or not exercise a termination option. We make \\ncertain qualitative and quantitative assumptions when deriving the \\nvalue of the economic incentive. \\n113 | ROGERS COMMUNICATIONS INC. 2023 ANNUAL REPORT'),\n",

Additionally, the contra ct should provide us with the \\nright to substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of \\nthe asset. \\nWe\\n also make judgments in determining whether we have the right \\nto control the use of the identified asset. We have that right when \\nwe have the decision-making rights that are most relevant to \\nchanging how and for what purpose the asset is used. In rare cases \\nwhere the decisions about how and for what purpose the asset is \\nused are predetermined, we have the right to direct the use of the \\nasset if we have the right to operate the asset or if we designed the \\nasset in a way that predetermines how and for what purpose the \\nasset will be used. \\nWe make judgments in determining the incremental borrowing \\nrate used to measure our lease liability for each lease contract, \\nincluding an estimate of the asset-specific security impact. The \\nincremental borrowing rate should reflect the interest that we \\nwould have to pay to borrow the funds necessary to obtain a similar \\nasset at a similar term, with a similar security, in a similar economic \\nenvironment. \\nCertain of our leases contain extension or renewal options that are \\nexercisable only by us and not by the lessor. At lease \\ncommencement, we assess whether we are reasonably certain to \\nexercise any of the extension options based on our expected \\neconomic return from the lease. We are typically reasonably certain \\nof exercising extension options on our network leases, primarily \\ndue to the significant cost that would be required to relocate our \\nnetwork towers and related equipment. We reassess whether we \\nare reasonably certain to exercise the options if there is a significant \\nevent or significant change in circumstance within our control and \\naccount for any changes at the date of the reassessment. \\nLessor\\n \\nWe ma ke judgments in determining whether a lease should be \\nclassified as an operating lease or a finance lease based on if the \\nagreement transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incidental \\nto ownership of the underlying asset. \\nLEASE LIABILITIES \\nWe primarily lease land and buildings relating to our wireless and \\ncable networks, our retail store presence, and certain of our offices \\nand other corporate buildings, as well as customer premise \\nequipment.

We estimate the \\ndiscounted future cash flows for periods of up to five years, \\ndepending on the CGU, and a terminal value. The future cash flows \\nare based on our estimates and expected future operating results \\nof the CGU after considering economic conditions and a general \\noutlook for the CGU’s industry. Our discount rates consider market \\nrates of return, debt to equity ratios, and certain risk premiums, \\namong other things. The terminal value is the value attributed to \\nthe CGU’s operations beyond the projected time period of the \\ncash flows using a perpetuity ra te based on expected economic \\nconditions and a general outlook for the industry. \\nWe determine fair value less costs to sell in one of the following two \\nways: \\n• analyzing discounted cash flow s—we estimate the discounted \\nfuture cash flows for five-year periods and a terminal value, \\nsimilar to the value in use methodology described above, while \\napplying assumptions consistent with those a market participant \\nwould make.

We make \\njudgments to determine that these assets have indefinite lives, \\nanalyzing all relevant factors, including the expected usage of the \\nasset, the typical life cycle of the asset, and anticipated changes in \\nthe market demand for the products and services the asset helps \\ngenerate.

We calculate the \\ncurrent tax expense using tax rates enacted or substantively \\nenacted as at the reporting date, including any adjustment to taxes \\npayable or receivable related to previous years. \\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities arise from temporary differences \\nbetween the carrying amounts of the assets and liabilities we \\nrecognize on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position \\nand their respective tax bases. We calculate deferred tax assets and \\nliabilities using enacted or substantively enacted tax rates that will \\napply in the years in which the temporary differences are expected \\nto reverse. \\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are  offset  if there is a legally \\nenforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities and they \\nrelate to income taxes levied by the same authority on: \\n• the same taxable entity; or \\n• different taxable entities where these entities intend to settle \\ncurrent tax assets and liabilities on a net basis or the tax assets \\nand liabilities will be realized and settled simultaneously. \\nWe recognize a deferred tax asset for unused losses, tax credits, \\nand deductible temporary differences to the extent it is probable \\nthat future taxable income will be available to use the asset. \\nJUDGMENTS \\nWe make significant judgments in interpreting tax rules and \\nregulations when we calculate income tax expense.

The \\ndifference is recognized in the FVTOCI investment reserve. \\nWe consider financial assets to be in default when, in the case of \\ncontract assets, accounts receivable, and financing receivables, the \\ncounterparty is unlikely to satisfy it s obligations to us in full. Our \\ninvestments measured at FVTOCI cannot default. To determine if \\nour financial assets are in default, we consider the amount of time \\nfor which the individual asset has been outstanding, the reason for \\nthe amount being outstanding (for example, if the customer has \\nongoing service or, if they have been deactivated, whether \\nvoluntarily or involuntarily), and the risk profile of the underlying \\ncustomers. We typically write off accounts receivable when they \\nhave been outstanding for a significant period of time. \\nESTIMATES \\nFair value estimates related to our derivatives are made at a specific \\npoint in time based on relevant market information and information \\nabout the underlying financial instruments. These estimates require \\nassessment of the credit risk of the parties to the instruments and \\nthe instruments’ discount rates. These fair values and underlying \\nestimates are also used in the tests of effectiveness of our hedging \\nrelationships. \\nWe make estimates when determining the credit losses we expect \\nto recognize on an asset while taking into account whether we use \\na twelve-month period or the asset’s lifetime. \\nJUDGMENTS \\nWe make significant judgments in determining whether our \\nfinancial instruments qualify for hedge accounting. These \\njudgments include assessing whether the forecast transactions \\ndesignated as hedged items in hedging relationships will \\nmaterialize as forecast, whether the hedging relationships \\ndesignated as effective hedges for accounting purposes continue \\nto qualitatively be effective, and determining the methodology to \\ndetermine the fair values used in testing the effectiveness of \\nhedging relationships. \\nFINANCIAL RISKS \\nWe are exposed to credit, liquidity, market price, foreign exchange, \\nand interest rate risks.

We expect to exit these premises in the \\nfuture and we therefore make prov isions for the costs associated \\nwith decommissioning the assets and restoring the locations to \\ntheir original conditions when we have a legal or constructive \\nobligation to do so. We calculate these costs based on a current \\nestimate of the costs that will be incurred, project those costs into \\nthe future based on management’s best estimates of future trends \\nin prices, inflation, and other fact ors, and discount them to their \\npresent value. We revise our forecasts when business conditions or \\ntechnological requirements change. \\nWhen we recognize a decommission ing liability, we recognize a \\ncorresponding \\nasset in “property, plant and equipment” (as  \\nproperty, plant and equipment or a right-of-use asset, as applicable \\nbased on the underlying asset) and depreciate the asset based on \\nthe corresponding asset’s useful life following our depreciation \\npolicies for property, plant and equipment and right-of-use assets, \\nas applicable. We recognize the accretion of the liability as a \\ncharge to “finance costs” on the Consolidated Statements of \\nIncome. \\nRestructuring \\nWe make provisions for restructur ing when we have approved a \\ndetailed and formal restructuring\\n plan and either the restructuring \\nhas started or management ha s announced the plan’s main \\nfeatures to the employees affected by it. Restructuring obligations \\nthat have uncertain timing or amounts are recognized as \\n“provisions”; otherwise they are recognized as accrued liabilities. All \\ncharges are recognized in “restructuring, acquisition and other” on \\nthe Consolidated Statements of Income (see note 11). \\nOnerous contracts \\nWe make provisions for onerous contracts when the unavoidable \\ncosts of meeting our obliga\\ntion under a contract exceed the \\nbenefits we expect to realize from it. We measure these provisions \\nat the present value of the lower of the expected cost of \\nterminating the contract or the expected cost of continuing with \\nthe contract. We recognize any impairment loss on the assets \\nassociated with the contract before we make the provision. \\nESTIMATES \\nWe recognize a provision when a past event creates a legal or \\nconstructive obligation that can be reasonably estimated and is \\nlikely to result in an outflow of economic resources. We recognize a \\nprovision even when the timing or amount of the obligation may \\nbe uncertain, which can require us to use significant estimates. \\nJUDGMENTS \\nJudgment is required to determine when we are subject to \\nunavoidable costs arising from onerous contracts. These judgments \\nmay include, for example, whether a certain promise is legally \\nbinding or whether we may be successful in negotiations with the \\ncounterparty. \\nPROVISIONS DETAILS \\n(In millions of dollars) \\nDecommissioning \\nliabilities\\n Other Total \\nDecember 31, 2022 56 13 69 \\nAdditions – 5 5 \\nProvisions assumed (note 3) 6 – 6 \\nAdjustments to existing \\np\\nrovisions (1) (3) (4) \\nDecember 31, 2023 61 15 76 \\nCurrent (recorded in “other \\ncurrent liabilities”)\\n 9 13 22 \\nLong-term 52 2 54 \\nDecommissioning and restoration costs \\nCash outflows associated with our decommissioning liabilities are \\ngenerally expected to occur at\\n the decommissioning dates of the \\nassets to which they relate, which are long-term in nature.

We use a discount rate \\nbased on market yields on high-quality corporate bonds at the \\nmeasurement date to calculate the accrued pension benefit \\nobligation. Remeasurements of the accrued pension benefit \\nobligation are determined at the end of the year and include \\nactuarial gains and losses, return s on plan assets in excess of \\ninterest income, and any change in the effect of the asset ceiling. \\nThese are recognized in other comprehensive income and retained \\nearnings. \\nThe cost of pensions is actuar ially determined and takes into \\naccount the following assumptions and methods for pension \\naccounting related to our defined benefit pension plans:\\n \\n• expected rates of salary increa ses for calculating increases in \\nfuture benefits; \\n• mortality rates for calculating\\n the life expectancy of plan \\nmembers; and \\n• past se\\nrvice costs from plan amendments are immediately \\nexpensed in net income. \\nWe recognize our net pension ex pense for our defined benefit\\n \\npension plans and contributions to defined contribution plans as\\n \\nan employee benefit expense in “operating costs” on the \\nConsolidated Statements of Income in the periods the employees \\nprovide the related services. \\nPost-employment benefits – defined contribution pension plan \\nIn 2016, we closed the defined benefit pension plans to new \\nmembers and introduced a defined \\ncontribution pension plan.

The goal of the program is to replace existing diesel \\ngenerators with renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind, and \\nlithium-ion batteries, that have been designed to be self-sustaining \\nby utilizing energy storage systems and renewable energy sources \\nfor power. In 2021, we initiated this program at seven wireless \\nnetwork sites and have continue d adding additional sites along \\nHighway 652 in Northern Ontario, reducing GHG emissions \\nannually. Collectively, these initiatives have improved the network \\nfor our customers by increasing the reliability and availability of our \\ncellular services through investment in modern, efficient, and \\nsustainable power solutions and converted the cell sites from diesel \\noperations to cleaner sources of energy. \\nEngaging suppliers to set their own science-based targets \\nTo further reduce our Scope 3 GHG emissions, we will engage with \\nour key suppliers and investments to assist them in setting their \\nown science-based targets. In 2023, we engaged our Tier 1 \\nsuppliers by administering an enhanced Ethical Procurement \\nPractices (EPP) Survey, which included more rigorous \\nenvironmental, emissions, and energy reduction targeting and \\nreporting. Through this outreach, we encouraged their \\ncommitment to SBTi and informed them of our increased \\nexpectations surrounding sustainable products, services, and \\npractices. \\nAlso in 2023, we collaborated with the Canadian Business for Social \\nResponsibility and two of our in\\ndustry players to determine a \\ntelecommunications industry a pproach to engaging with and \\nassisting our supply chain in measuring, and establishing reduction \\ntargets for, their own GHG emissions.'),\n",
